Instructions to run the program:<br />
<br />
-first I suggest you create a virtual python enviroment using command: python -m venv venv for windows and python3 -m venv venv for macOS <br />
-then activate the venv by making sure you're in the same directory as it then use command: ./venv/Scripts/Activate for windows and source venv/bin/activate for macOS <br />
-make sure the venv is also in the same directory as the python files. <br />
-after activating install the requirements.txt using command:  pip install -r requirements.txt for windows and  pip3 install -r requirements.txt for macOS <br />
-then you can run the programs using python Task1Method1.py, python Task1Method2.py, python Task2.py for windows and python3 Task1Method1.py, python3 Task1Method2.py, python3 Task2.py for macOS <br />
-the programs will create plots and store them in 5 folders as png files. Task1Method1 and Task1Method2 will create one folder each and then Task2 will create 3 folders
